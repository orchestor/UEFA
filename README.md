## **üéÆ How to Use**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Start Simulation**

- The tournament starts from the **Round of 16**.
- The application simulates all matches **until the final champion is determined**.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Match Simulation**
Each match follows:
1. **Regular time**: Goals are calculated based on team strength.
2. **Extra time**: If tied, teams have a chance to score in extra time.
3. **Penalty shootout**: If still tied, penalties decide the winner.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Winning Team**
- The final **champion** is displayed with a **golden text** and its **team logo**.

---

## **‚öΩ Team Strengths**
Each team has predefined **attack & defense** ratings:
```python
team_strength = {
    "real_madrid": (90, 85), "barcelona": (85, 80), "bayern": (88, 86), "man_city": (92, 88),
    "liverpool": (87, 83), "chelsea": (82, 80), "juventus": (80, 78), "psg": (89, 85),
    "dortmund": (78, 76), "inter_milan": (83, 80), "ac_milan": (82, 79), "atletico": (84, 82),
    "arsenal": (81, 78), "tottenham": (79, 76), "napoli": (80, 77), "leipzig": (76, 72)
}
```
- **Higher attack** = more goals scored.
- **Higher defense** = harder to concede goals.

---
